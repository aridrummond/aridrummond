### Hi, I'm Ari 👋  

I'm a **marine biologist & sensory ecologist** exploring how animals perceive and navigate their world.  
I work across morphology, physiology, behaviour, global change ecology and data science – **from tide pools to RStudio**.

### 🔬 What I do  

- Study **sensory systems** and how organisms use them!
- Examine correlations between morphology, physiology, and behaviour
- Use **crustaceans** and marine invertebrates as models to understand biological processes and **impacts of anthropogenic change**
- Assess how environmental stressors (climate, pollution, etc.) alter information gathering and use
- Combine imaging (**SEM, microscopy**) with experimental and statistical approaches  
- Build reproducible workflows in **R** (LMEMs, GLMs, GAMs, mixed models, rptR, brms)
- Learn and apply **Python** for data handling, modelling, and automation
- Explore **AI** tools to develop ethical, novel applications for research and science communication
- Investigate **structure–function relationships** in marine and intertidal systems
- Communicate science through **photography & visual storytelling**

### 📊 Tools & Skills  

**R** (tidyverse, mgcv, lme4, rptR, coxme) • Git/GitHub • Data wrangling  
Morphometrics • Physiological studies • Behavioural assays • SEM prep/imaging • Microscopy & histology •
Experimental design • Reproducible analysis • Quarto/Markdown

### 🌱 I'm currently learning

- Python
- DeepLabCut
- Yolov8
- Agentic AI in academic administrative task optimisation

### 🐚 Current projects  

- Sensory morphology & behaviour modelling (LMEMs)  
- Individual differences in response behaviour ((hierarchal) mixed models, Bayesian stats)  
- Marine lab & fieldwork documentation for outreach and teaching  
- Developing reproducible R workflows for biological research

### Education

- PhD (2026 soon!!; *University of Plymouth*): Biological Sciences - Thesis: Crustacean Sensation: Information acquisition and use in an intertidal hermit crab
- MRes (2022; *UoP*): Marine Biology - Dissertation: Task-solving and decision-making in *Pagurus bernhardus*
- MRes (2018; *UCL*): Anthropology - Dissertation: Daytime roosting ecology and behaviour of the spectacled flying fox 
- BA (2005; *Dickinson College*)

### 📸 Outside the code  
I use macro and intertidal photography to document invertebrate life and capture the tiny, strange, beautiful worlds animals build and inhabit.
